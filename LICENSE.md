The non-infringement battle. Doesnt use any media 
that would be legally problematic, in order to
preserve the codes availability.


some code used (some of the basic structure of the mob.js)
comes from https://github.com/OldSchoolSDK/InfernoTrainer

by virtue of that being GPL-3.0 license, this project is too.


howler.js is from https://github.com/goldfire/howler.js
Specifically https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/howler/2.2.4/howler.min.js
